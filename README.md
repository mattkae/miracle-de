**WARNING**: This project is very much a work in progress. I have provided a rough roadmap in the timeline section.
Use at your own risk.

# miracle-de
**miracle-de** is a  Wayland desktop environment inspired by modern IDEs and based on [miracle-wm](https://github.com/mattkae/miracle-wm).
The shell focuses on usability for programmers by being extendable and providing a JetBrains-inspried interface. While window managers like i3 and sway
are simple but barebones, miracle will provide a heavier out-of-the-box-solution that is geared towards making
the life of the average programmer happy and productive. If you like the lightweight nature of other IDEs, then this
one might not be for you. But if you want your desktop environment to provide a host of useful facilities at your
fingertips, then look no futher!
